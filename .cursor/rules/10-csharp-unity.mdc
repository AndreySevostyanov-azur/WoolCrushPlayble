# C# / Unity Standards

## Style
- Prefer explicit types in public APIs; `var` allowed for obvious RHS.
- Use clear names with suffixes:
  - `*System` for ECS systems
  - `*Component` for components
  - `*Tag` for tag components
  - `*Event` for event components/entities
- Keep methods short; extract helpers when logic exceeds ~40–60 lines.

## Unity specifics
- Avoid using `MonoBehaviour.Update()` for gameplay logic; prefer ECS systems.
- If you must interact with Unity objects, do it via dedicated bridge/services (already present in repo patterns).

## Error handling
- Fail fast in init/config validation (throw with clear message) but avoid exceptions in hot `Run()` loops.
- Validate config presence once, cache references, avoid repeated provider calls each tick.
